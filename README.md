It is not mandatory to solve all the exercises.
We would like to have a clear and fair insight in your experiences and not to get a biased impression.
After all when we're going to meet with you all we'll detect who cheated, if any! üòÅ

Some exercises foresee some bonus tasks and requirements, some don't.
This evaluation will be focused on your approach to the problem, we aren't going to benchmark you solutions!

Whenever you are ready clone this repository into your GitHub account and start coding!
#### <center> We recommend you not to directly fork this repo: forked repos are easy to find and we don't want you to copy from each other... üòâ </center>

We'll clone the repo as soon as we hear back from you and we'll test and understand the code you wrote and report to you all!

## <center> Your solutions must be returned in the form of a clone-able link to a GitHub repository of your own. <br/><br/> Please refer to the email communication for deadline definition!</center>
